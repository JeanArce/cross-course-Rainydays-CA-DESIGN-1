HTML is a markup language used to structure the content of web pages. CSS is a stylesheet language that controls the visual appearance of HTML elements. JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of web development, allowing for the creation of visually appealing and interactive websites.


## Getting Started

This design is based on a prototype that I created on Figma. As you can see, I have 2 different kinds of designs for mobile and desktop. I concentrated on a desktop prototype which is not a perfect design, especially on a hero page that has no nav bar menu but has a nav icon. I added user icon along with other icons instead. I did some changes like adding an order-summary and user file which I copied from my mobile prototype on Figma.
I used dev tools to debug and also inspect elements and styles.
WAVE is a web accessibility tool thats shows a summary of errors, alerts, and others. It displays the wrong code that you made. And there is a references at the same time . It's pretty cool to use.
Validator.w3.org(Nu HTML Checker) is very helpful too. It's telling you which line and column of a code need to fix.

### Changes

Added file: order-summary.html and user.html
hamburger menu only on mobile.
css: custom.css(casacding variables)-MDN
