This project is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to buy a product or services from Rainydays over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile application. Customers can purchase items from the comfort of their own homes or workplaces. Shopping online is made easier and convenient for the customer, it also save time.

## Getting Started

This design is based on a prototype that I created on Figma. As you can see, I have 2 different kinds of designs for mobile and desktop. I concentrated on a desktop prototype which is not a perfect design, especially on a hero page that has no nav bar menu but has a nav icon. I added user icon along with other icons instead. I did some changes like adding an order-summary and user file which I copied from my mobile prototype on Figma.
I used dev tools to debug and also inspect elements and styles.
WAVE is a web accessibility tool thats shows a summary of errors, alerts, and others. It displays the wrong code that you made. And there is a references at the same time . It's pretty cool to use.
Validator.w3.org(Nu HTML Checker) is very helpful too. It's telling you which line and column of a code need to fix.
